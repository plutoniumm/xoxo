A quantum-inspired take on tic-tac-toe played on a 3×3×3 grid. Each player places superposed marks, which collapse to definite positions after each round.

### Rules
- The game is played on a 3×3×3 grid.
- Players take turns placing two tentative marks (superpositions) on different cells.
- After each round (two X moves and two O moves), the state collapses: one definitive X and one definitive O remain.
- The game continues until the board resolves; three in a row wins!
